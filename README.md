# JavaScript Quiz (Bootcamp Challenge 4)

## Introduction and Purpose:

I wrote this quiz application as an exercise in DOM and local storage manipulation using JavaScript.

## Scenario:

A coding bootcamp student wishes to track their progress in memorising JavaScript facts.

## Technical Overview:

The application administers a 60-second quiz, penalising wrong answers by subtracting fifteen seconds from the time remaining. If the user successfully completes the quiz, they enter their initials and their score is recorded. The record persists in browser local storage until explicitly cleared.

## Results:

The application is currently live on [GitHub Pages](https://tadcos29.github.io/JS-fundamentals-quiz) 

The GitHub repository for the project is: https://github.com/tadcos29/JS-fundamentals-quiz

## Potential Issues:

* The CSS could be more consolidated.
